* Added TF import functionality to all resources
* Acceptance tests for resource updates

## v0.0.16

* Due to a glitch in time-space continuum, this is identical to v0.0.15

## v0.0.15

### Caching polices for tables and views in follower databases

* Added acceptance tests for caching policies on materialized views
* `follower_database` flag for both table and mv caching policies

### Materialized View Improvements

* Acceptance tests for materialized views
* Materialized view bug fixes (found by new acceptance tests)
* allow_mv_without_rls flag for both rls & mv policy creation to help with common issues creating views on top of tables configured with RLS

## v0.0.14

* added csv, orc, parquet mapping types
* fixed cache concurrecy issue, fixed bug in hasStatementResults

## v0.0.13

* Added retention, caching, and RLS policies for materialized views

`adx_materialized_view_caching_policy`
`adx_materialized_view_retention_policy`
`adx_materialized_view_row_level_security_policy`

* Input validation bug fixes for mapping and function resources
* Fixed cluster uri param name in docs
* Fixed possible duplication of function resources

## v0.0.12

* Resource IDs of `adx_table` and `adx_table_mapping` were changed to match the structure of the newly added resources. Should have no impact on normal operation.
* Lazy Init of provider to resolve Issue Unable to create adx and then use the provider at the same time #2
* Cluster config per resource (to manage resources across multiple clusters)
* Refactoring of client & query helpers
* Checks for deleted resources in ADX (previously this caused errors and this provider would not recognize to re-create them)
* Client caching for optimizing control of many resources across many clusters (client per cluster)

## v0.0.11

* New resource: `adx_table_caching_policy`
* New resource: `adx_table_partitioning_policy`
* New resource: `adx_materialized_view`

## v0.0.10

### Table resource improvements:

* Ability to update table definitions (.alter & .alter-merge),
* Table creation from query (.set, .set-or-replace etc..)

### New resources:

* User defined functions
* Table row level security policy
* Table batch ingestion policy
* Table Retention policy
* Table update policy
* Added helper methods for improving ID generation & maintaining policy objects (to make adding more policy types easier)

Table and table mapping resources were not updated to use the new id generation since it requires state migration
